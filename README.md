# Personal Portfolio

This is a modern, responsive, and interactive portfolio website built with React.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, designed to highlight my skills, showcase projects, and provide a professional online presence. It serves as both a technical demonstration of frontend capabilities and a personal branding tool.

The UI is crafted using shadcn/ui, offering accessible and customizable components that align with current design best practices. For motion and interactivity, GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) powers smooth and performant animations, enhancing the user experience without compromising performance.
